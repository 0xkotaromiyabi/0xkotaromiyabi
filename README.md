## 🧭 About

I exist at the intersection of **code, philosophy, and infrastructure** — exploring how technology reshapes meaning, ownership, and human coordination.

* 🧱 Web3 builder crafting decentralized systems
* 🤖 AI tinkerer experimenting with models, agents, and local-first intelligence
* 📡 Radio streaming infrastructure engineer (signal, voice, presence)
* 🎓 Blockchain educator translating complexity into understanding
* 📖 Thinker in the philosophy of technology & on-chain society

I don’t just build software.
I study what software does to humans.
